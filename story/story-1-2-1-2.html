<h1> You crack the door open only for it to be torn off by the Nature Boy himself, Ric Flair. Ric hands you a rifle and gestures for you to come with him. He explains to you that there is an army fortifying the exits so nobody can escape. You and Ric Flair are now armed to the teeth, and you have a choice to make.</h1>
